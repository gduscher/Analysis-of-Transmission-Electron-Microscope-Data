# Analysis-of-Transmission-Electron-Microscope-Data

This is a book which consists of a collection of jupyter notebooks.

The content is based on the notebooks I used for my Lecture MSE672: *Introduction to Transmission Electron Microscopy* in Fall 2018.

The topic of the book is how to analyze electron microscopy data.

Please start with the notebook **_Analysis_of_Transmission_Electron_Microscope_Data.ipynb** which contains the **Outline** and the basic usage of this
 book. The notebooks are however rather self-contained and can be accessed in any order.
 
However, **CH1-Prerequesites.ipynb** is a notebook that let's you install and test all the necessary packages.

In **CH1_pyUSID.ipynb** you will get familiar with the data format.
 
For usage at your computer you'll have to download the whole repostory onto your computer and start the jupyter notebook server.

I use annaconda3 for the installation of python and  the jupter notebook server, but any other configuration works equally well.

Have fun,

Gerd
