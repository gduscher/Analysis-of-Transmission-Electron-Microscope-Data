# Analysis-of-Transmission-Electron-Microscope-Data

This is a book which consists of a collection of notebooks.

The content is based on th notebooks I used for my Lecture MSE672 Introduction to Transmission Electron Microscopy.

The topic of the book is how to analyze electron microscopy data.

Please start with the notebook **_Analysis_of_Transmission_Electron_Microscope_Data.ipynb** which contains the **Outline** and the basic usage of this
 book. The notebooks are however rather self-contained and can be accessed in any order.
 
For usage at your computer you'll have to download the whole repostory onto your computer and start the jupyter notebook server.

Have fun,

Gerd
